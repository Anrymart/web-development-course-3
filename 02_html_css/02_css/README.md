## Layouts

1. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_website_layout.asp - this article explains how to build layouts using CSS float.
   This was the primary way before CSS flexbox and CSS grid layouts appeared (before CSS float, we mostly used HTML table to build layouts).
2. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/ - CSS flexbox is a relatively simple, but very powerful tool.
   The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its itemsâ€™ width/height (and order) 
   to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). 
   A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
3. https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/ - CSS grid is a very powerful tool for two-dimensional layouts.
